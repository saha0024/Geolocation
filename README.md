#Adding GitHub Readme Notes

##MarkDown


**Author:** *Parisa Saharkhiz*

**Description**

The purpose of this exercise is for you to write a full ReadMe file for one of your GitHub Repos.
The ReadMe file inside your GitHub projects is a MarkDown file.

**Instruction**

I built a webpage that will check to see if the current browser supports the navigator.geolocation object.
