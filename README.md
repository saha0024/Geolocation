##MarkDown


**Author:** *Parisa Saharkhiz*

**Description**

MarkDown is an alternative simple syntax for formatting text files. Many text editors now support markdown syntax natively.
The purpose of this exercise is for you to write a full ReadMe file for one of your GitHub Repos.
The ReadMe file inside your GitHub projects is also a MarkDown file.

**Instruction**

I built a webpage that will check to see if the current browser supports the navigator.geolocation object.
In this app, you can see the map of a location from Google Map. It takes a few seconds to load the picture.
